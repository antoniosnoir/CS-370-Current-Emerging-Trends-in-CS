### Brielfly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The goal of this project was to train the AI to solve a maze puzzle. We were given code that came with controllers for default variables as well as the number of episodes to use. The code that had to be written centered on creating episodes, epochs, switching between random moves or an algorithm, and using the win and loss states with previous actions.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists harness the power of computing to create solutions that help advance human progress in ethical manners. This particular class focused on the field of AI, which is gaining more popularity as time progresses. It's important to know about AI because this technology will soon be in many everyday areas of our lives, which means that we need to be conscious of non-ethical use of this technology and stop it early on. Computer scientists are dedicated professionals who are able to control the direction of progress and hopefully step in to solve any issues that might arise from innapropriate use of technology. 

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by trying to break into smaller problems that are easier to understand because this allows me to understand even complex issues. I try to understand what lead to the problem and how can I fix anything along the line so that the problem is fixed. When broken down into smaller, easier to understand components, even the most seemingly insurmountable problem can have a solution. Even though it might take a while to find the solution, any progress in the right direction is progress enough.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are paramount to the end user and the orgazniation. As a computer scientist, I will be entrusted, and have access, to extremely private data and I owe it to the end user and the organization to keep this data as protected as possible. I have many years of experience in handling extremely private information, but now as a computer scientist, I have learned how to keep this information private in the digital realm. The GDPR sets very specific guidelines that I, along with other fellow computer scientists, must adhere to in order to protect data and assure that our work lines up with ethical practices.
